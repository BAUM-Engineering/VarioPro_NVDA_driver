# VarioPro_NVDA_driver
NVDA driver for BAUM VarioPro Braille display and its modules
More information about can be found here:
http://www.baum.de/en/products/braille-displays/variopro-80/

Although NVDA already includes a driver for some of the BAUM Braille displays, 
we choose to make a separate driver for the BAUM VarioPro product.
This is mainly due to the fact that VarioPro has also additional connectible modules.

## How to install this driver in NVDA
Ensure that you have installed the latest version of the NVDA screen reader. 
Download the baumVarioPro.py file from this page.
Copy the baumVarioPro.py file to your %appdata%\nvda\brailleDisplayDrivers folder.
